- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ajimenezsa, a software developer from Spain :)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things, but lately, my thing is Java, on the backend side.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a little bit of ML with python, a little bit of React, and I read something about quantum computing from time to time.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Just search ajimenezsa on Twitter. :)
